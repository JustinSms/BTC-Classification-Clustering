# BTC-Classification-Clustering

During our Advanced Data Analysis course, my classmate and I worked on an engaging project. Our task involved handling extensive CSV files containing Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. Initially, we conducted a thorough analysis of these transactions, and then we engaged in feature engineering by creating additional attributes, including account balance, average amount of monthly input/output transactions, account age, and more. Subsequently, we categorized the transactions based on their nature, such as mining, gambling, and exchanges, employing the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification. After this step, we removed the label column and proceeded to cluster the dataset, aiming to correctly group transactions without prior knowledge of their labels. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we employed three methods: dimensionality reduction using t-SNE for a visual approach, as well as mathematical approaches like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. We used the K-Means clustering algorithm for this task. In our final exercise, we decided to conduct whale watching within the cryptocurrency domain. Whale watching entails observing and analyzing large BTC transactions made by influential market players, offering valuable insights into market trends and behaviors. This project not only refined our data analysis skills but also provided us with valuable experience in handling substantial datasets, contributing to a comprehensive learning journey.
